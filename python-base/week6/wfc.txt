Companionship of Books
A man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the company he keeps; for there is a companionship of books as well as of men; and one should always live in the best company,whether it be of books or of men.
A good book may be among the best of friends.It is the same today that it always was,and it will never change.It is the most patient and cheerful of companions.It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress.It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth,and comforting and consoling us in age.
